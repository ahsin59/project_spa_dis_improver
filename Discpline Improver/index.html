            <p class="fst-italic">
              The user interface is the point of human computer interaction and communication in a device.
              So we‘ll provide the simple and very much friendly user interface to the user. Our user
              interface contains icons and cards relevant to the actions. User will easily communicate with
              the system through simple conversation. No specialized computer staff will require. A
              hardware interface specifies the plugs, sockets, cables and electrical signals that pass through
              each line between the CPU and a peripheral device or communications network. It also
              stipulates which data trigger which functions, and the control software that "drives" the
              hardware
            </p>
            <p>
              Motherboards : The CPU socket on the motherboard determines which CPU chips can be used
              in the computer. Peripheral cards, such as high-end graphics cards, plug into the bus on the
              motherboard inside the computer case. The most common bus is PCI Express.
              The most widely used hardware interface for attaching external devices to computers is USB.
              It connects keyboards, mice, printers, cameras, music players, flash drives and external storage
              drives. In addition, SATA is a common storage drive and optical drive interface, and NVMe is
              an increasingly popular SSD interface. The GPIB IEEE 488 standard is used for process
              control.instruments.
              
            </p>
            <p>
              Networks :The de facto standard for connecting devices to local networks (LANs) is Ethernet,
              which is also used to hook up a cable or DSL modem. The standards for wireless are Wi-Fi
              and Bluetooth. See Ethernet, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and standards.

            <h3>Software Interfaces</h3>
            <p>The application will run on all Android devices running 4.1 (JellyBean) or Later. The
              application will respond to the size of the screen of android smart phone the application is
              running in. This application must require an internet connection. User can run this app without
              internet as well. Data of the user will store in Firebase database. The development team will
              follow best practices for clean code and software modularity in order to make the application as
              maintainable as possible. This application will develop in Android Studio by using XML and
              Java language and connected with the Firebase database. Application Will not require any
              personal data from the user. User interface is the front-end application view to which user
              interacts in order to use the software. User can manipulate and control the software as well as
              hardware by means of user interface. Today, user interface is found at almost every place where
              digital technology exists, right from computers, mobile phones, cars, music players, airplanes,
              ships etc.
              User interface is part of software and is designed such a way that it is expected to provide the
              user insight of the software. UI provides fundamental platform for human-computer interaction.
              UI can be graphical, text-based, audio-video based, depending upon the underlying hardware
              and software combination. UI can be hardware or software or a combination of both</p>
              <p>The software becomes more popular if its user interface is:</p>

            <ul>
              <li><i class="bi bi-check"></i> Attractive.</li>
              <li><i class="bi bi-check"></i> Simple to use.</li>
              <li><i class="bi bi-check"></i> Responsive in short tim.</li>
              <li><i class="bi bi-check"></i> Clear to understand.</li>
              <li><i class="bi bi-check"></i> Consistent on all interfacing screens.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              UI is broadly divided into two categories:

            </p>
            <p>
              <ul>
                <li><i class="bi bi-check"></i> Command Line Interface </li>
                <li><i class="bi bi-check"></i> Graphical User Interface</li>
                <p>Graphical User Interface provides the user graphical means to interact with the system.
                  GUI can be combination of both hardware and software. Using GUI, user interprets the
                  software.
                </p>  
                <p>Typically, GUI is more resource consuming than that of CLI. With advancing
                  technology, the programmers and designers create complex GUI designs that work with
                  more efficiency, accuracy and speed.

            <p class="fst-italic">
              The proposed product will be purely dynamic. All the values which are to be required by the
              system may be entered at run time. Application will be fully flexible. User interface of this
              application will be fully flexible, simple and easy to user. User will easily use this app without
              any special guidance. User interface of this app will be adjustable by screen of the Android
              smart phone. It will be fully tested and error free and maintainable.
              Availability: This attribute is indicative as to whether an application will execute the tasks it is
              assigned to perform. Availability also includes certain concepts that relate to software
              security, performance, integrity, reliability, dependability, and confidentiality. In addition, topnotch availability indicates that a software-driven system will repair any operating faults so that
              service outage periods would not exceed a specific time value. Interoperability Software-driven
              systems could be required to communicate and act in tandem to solve certain tasks.
              Interoperability describes the ability of two systems to engage in the exchange of information via
              certain interfaces. Therefore, Software Quality Assurance engineers must examine the
              interoperability attribute in terms of both syntactic and semantic interoperability.
              Performance: This attribute pertains to the ability of a software-driven system to conform to
              timing requirements. From a testing point of view, it implies that Software Testing engineers
              must check whether the system responds to various events within defined time limits. These
              events may occur in the form of clock events, process interruptions, messages, and requests from
              different users, and others. Testability: Software testability indicates how well a software-driven
              system allows Software Testing professionals to conduct tests in line with predefined criteria. 
              39
              This attribute also assesses the ease with which Software Quality Assurance engineers can
              develop test criteria for a said system and its various components. Engineers can assess
              the testability of a system by using various techniques such as encapsulation, interfaces, patterns,
              low coupling, and more. Security : This attribute measures the ability of a system to arrest and
              block malicious or unauthorized actions that could potentially destroy the system. The attribute
              assumes importance because security denotes the ability of the system to protect data and defend
              information from unauthorized access. Security also includes authorization and authentication
              techniques, protection against network attacks, data encryption, and such other risks. It is
              imperative for Software Testing Companies and professionals to regularly conduct updated
              security checks on systems. Usability : Every software-driven system is designed for ease of use
              to accomplish certain tasks. The attribute of usability denotes the ease with which users are able
              to execute tasks on the system; it also indicates the kind of user support provided by the system.
              The most well-known principle for this property is KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid). In addition,
              Software Quality Assurance engineers must test software to check whether it supports different
              accessibility types of control for people with disabilities. Usability has a critical and long
              standing bearing on the commercial fortunes of a software application or package. Functionality :
              This attribute determines the conformity of a software-driven system with actual requirements
              and specifications. Most Software Testing professionals view this attribute as crucial and a
              foremost requirement of a modern application, and would therefore advocate the performance of
              tests that assess the desired functionality of a system in the initial stages of Software Testing
              initiatives.

              WBS stands for Work Breakdown Structure A work breakdown structure (WBS) is a visual,
              hierarchical and deliverable-oriented deconstruction of a project. It is a helpful diagram for project
              managers because it allows them to break down their project scope and visualize all the tasks
              required to complete their projects. Project managers make use of project management software
              to lay out and execute a work breakdown structure. When used in combination with a Gantt chart
              that incorporates WBS levels and task hierarchies, project management software can be
             especially effective for planning, scheduling and executing projects. In a Work Breakdown 
             40 Structure (WBS) for project management, all tasks of project are illustrated to reflect their
             relations to each other and their ralations to the project in general. A WBS diagram can help
            project managers to predict results based on information listed in the diagram. It covers all
            procedures and phases of project in a logical way. Here is how to create a great WBS for project
             management.

            <h3>Firebase Database</h3>
            <p class="fst-italic">
              Firebase Real time Database is a Cloud hosted database, i.e. it runs on a cloud and access to the
              user is provided as a service. It stores data in JSON (Java script Object Notation) format, a
              format to store or transport data. All the users connected to it can get access to the data at Real
              Time. The Firebase Real-time Database is a cloud-hosted database. Data is stored as JSON and
              synchronized in real time to every connected client. When you build cross-platform apps with
              our Apple platforms, Android, and JavaScript SDKs, all of your clients share one Real-time
              Database instance and automatically receive updates with the newest data. Firebase is a
              Backend-as-a-Service (Baas). It provides developers with a variety of tools and services to help
              them develop quality apps, grow their user base, and earn profit. It is built on Google‘s
              infrastructure. Firebase is categorized as a NoSQL database program, which stores data in JSONlike documents. In Firebase, a document is a set of key-value pairs defined by a schema. A group
              of documents makes up a collection. Firebase is a Cloud-hosted, NoSQL database that uses a
              document-model. It can be horizontally scaled while letting you store and synchronize data in
              real-time among users. This is great for applications that are used across multiple devices such as
              mobile applications. Firebase is optimized for offline use with strong user-based security that
              allows for serverless based apps as well. Firebase is built on the Google infrastructure and is
              built to scale automatically. In addition to standard NoSQL database functionality, Firebase
              includes analytics, authentication, performance monitoring, messaging, crash reporting and much
              more. Because it is a Google product, there is also integration into a lot of other products. This
              includes integration with Google Ads, AdMob, Google Marketing Platform, the Play Store, Data
              Studio, BigQuery, Slack, Jira, and more.The Firebase APIs are packaged into a single SDK that
              can be expanded to multiple platforms and languages. This includes C++ and Unity, which are
              both popular for mobile development.
              Working with Firebase : A Firebase project is a pool of resources that can include a database as
              well as items such as user accounts, analytics, and anything that can be shared between a number
              of client applications. A Firebase application is a single application that can be backed by the
              Firebase Project. A Firebase project can have multiple Firebase applications within it.

            <p class="fst-italic">
              
            </p>
            <p>
              The development phase of the project starts after design. During this phase, design is modeled
              into working software. The software is developed in such a way that it can meet the requirements
              and specifications of the users. The implementation phase of any system is concerned with the
              tools used in the development work and the components used to implement the system.
              In Java, an interface or the abstract type used to denote an interface must be implemented by
              classes. The interfaces that a certain class implements determine whether various aspects of these
              classes are "known" by another class, or what kinds of knowledge one class has about another.
              One aspect of implementing an interface that can cause confusion is the requirement that to
              implement an interface, a class must implement all of the methods of that interface. This can lead
              to error messages due to insufficient implementation of methods. In general, the syntactical
              requirements of implementation and other Java tasks can be a burden for developers, and
              mastering this is part of becoming an in-depth Java user. A programming language
              implementation is a system for executing computer programs. There are two general approaches
              to programming language implementation: interpretation and compilation
              Interpretation is a method of executing a program. The program is read as input by an interpreter,
              which performs the actions written in the program,
              Compilation is a different process, where a compiler reads in a program, but instead of running
              the program, the compiler translates it into some other language, such as byte code or machine
              code. The translated code may either be directly executed by hardware, or serve as input to
              another interpreter or another compiler.

            <h3>Coding</h3>
            <p class="fst-italic">
              Coding is a group of characters and/or digits that identify and describe something in the business
              and online system. Codes are frequently used to describe customers, products, materials and
              events. Codes serve many useful purposes. Because codes often are shorter than the data they
              represent, they save storage space and costs, reduce transmission time, and decrease data entry
              time. Finally, codes can reduce data input errors in situations when the coded data is easier to
              remember and enter than the original source data, when only certain valid codes are allowed, and
              when something within the code itself can provide immediate verification then code is correct.
              Coding, sometimes called computer programming, is how we communicate with computers.
              Code tells a computer what actions to take, and writing code is like creating a set of instructions.
              By learning to write code, you can tell computers what to do or how to behave in a much faster
              way. You can use this skill to make websites and apps, process data, and do lots of other cool
              things. This machine-level programming language is the only language that computers can
              directly understand and are capable of making sense of.
              Coding is the process of transforming ideas, solutions, and instructions into the language that the
              computer can understand – that is, binary-machine code. Coding is how humans are able to talk
              with computers. Coding involves communicating and giving instructions for different actions we
              want our computers to perform using a computer programming language.

            <h3> Programming languages</h3>
            <p class="fst-italic">
              like JavaSctipt, Java, C/C++, or Python, act as the translator between
              humans and machines.
              These languages bridge the communication gap between computers and humans by representing,
              expressing, and putting algorithms into practice. They do this using a specific sequence of
              statements that machines understand and can follow. Programming languages are similar to
              human languages in the sense that they are made up of basic syntactical elements like nouns,
              verbs, and phrases. And you group these elements together to form something that resembles a
              sentence to create meaning. These languages actually resemble and look a lot like English. But
              they offer a shorter, more precise and less verbose way to create instructions that the computer
              can understand. A spoken/natural language like English, on the other hand, leaves a lot of room
              for ambiguity and different interpretations from different people.
              43
              Programming languages are a set of rules that define how you write computer code. We use
              computer code to create all the web applications, websites, games, operating systems, and all the
              other software programs and technologies we use on a daily basis. The binary code can vary
              from computer to computer and from machine to machine. When it comes to this level of
              programming a computer, there is no portability. This means that programs and software can't be
              transferred to different systems. Machine languages can vary depending on the operating system
              they are implemented on. This is, of course, very limiting. Machine code or binary code may run
              very fast, they may be the computer's native language, and they may be extremely efficient
              because the instructions are executed directly by the CPU. But it's a very dull and monotonous –
              not to mention extremely error-prone – way to use a computer. Attempting to use a computer by
              manually typing binary codes for each transitor is a cumbersome process. Making an error while
              directly managing the computer's data storage and operations is very hard to fix. Machine-level
              languages are hard for humans to read, write, learn and understand. So programmers and
              computer scientists found a better and arguably easier way to solve problems. The things a
              computer can do by itself are on a very primitive level and are limited in scope. They are good at
              performing arithmetic calculations like adding numbers or checking if a number is equal to zero.
              Humans created these machines that have revolutionized our way of life, but when it comes
              down to it, computers are really not that smart and have limited capabilities by themselves. They
              only do exactly what they are told to do. They don‘t make assumptions or have any common
              sense like humans do. Computers at their core are machines that perform mathematical
              operations. But they are also good at displaying some text on the screen or repeating a task over
              and over again.
              Those operations are basic and don‘t go much further than that. They're known as the
              computer‘s instruction set. Even though at their core computers can only do very basic tasks,
              they are able to perform extremely complex actions and follow and execute instructions from
              programs they are given. This is thanks to the many layers of abstraction they have. The true
              power however, lies in the hands of humans. Whatever we want to achieve and whatever we
              imagine, we can use this machine as a tool to do complicated calculations, conduct research to
              find and extract a document among billions of other documents, or keep in touch with friends
              and family far away. Whatever we can think of, we can now create it by coding a program
